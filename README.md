# IMDb-Sentiment-Prediction

## Introduction

This project is about predicting the sentiment of a movie review. The dataset used is the IMDb dataset which contains 50,000 reviews. The dataset is divided into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The reviews are labeled as positive or negative. The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict the sentiment of a review.


## Dataset

The dataset used is the IMDb dataset which contains 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The reviews are labeled as positive or negative. The dataset is available on the [TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imdb_reviews). The dataset is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

## RNN Model

The model used is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using `pytorch`. The RNN model is built using the Keras library. The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the testing dataset. The model is then used to predict the sentiment of a review.
